                    <p>
                      Prior to the late 19th century, time was a local matter. Each city or town set their clocks according to local solar time, 
                      which meant that time could vary by several minutes between neighboring towns. This wasn't a major issue when travel was 
                      slow and communication limited.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      However, with the development of railroads and the telegraph, the differences in local time became problematic. Train schedules 
                      were particularly confusing, with the same train arriving and departing at different "local times" as it moved across the country.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      In 1879, Canadian Sir Sandford Fleming proposed the system of worldwide time zones that we essentially still use today. 
                      His idea was to divide the world into 24 time zones, each one hour apart, based on the prime meridian (0Â° longitude) passing 
                      through Greenwich, London.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      On November 18, 1883, American and Canadian railroads implemented a standard time system, and within a year, most states 
                      had adopted one of the four standard time zones for the continental United States.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      The International Meridian Conference held in Washington, D.C. in 1884 established Greenwich as the prime meridian and 
                      recommended that the world adopt a system of 24 hour time zones.

                    <p>
                      The concept of daylight saving time (DST) was first proposed by Benjamin Franklin in 1784, but it wasn't implemented 
                      until much later. The first countries to adopt DST were Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1916, as a way to conserve coal 
                      during World War I.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      The United States adopted DST in 1918, but it was so unpopular that it was repealed the following year. During World War II, 
                      President Franklin Roosevelt instituted year-round DST, called "War Time," which lasted from 1942 to 1945.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      After the war, states and localities were free to choose when and if they observed DST, creating significant confusion. 
                      The Uniform Time Act of 1966 standardized the start and end dates for DST, but allowed states to exempt themselves if they passed laws to do so.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      Today, DST is observed in about 70 countries worldwide, affecting over a billion people. However, many countries near 
                      the equator do not change their clocks, as daylight hours are similar throughout the year.

                          This means that in the westernmost parts of China, the sun rises at around 10:00 AM in the winter.

                          The International Date Line (IDL) isn't a straight line - it zigzags around territories to keep countries and island groups 
                          in the same day. In 2011, Samoa moved from the east of the IDL to the west, skipping December 30, 2011 entirely, to align 
                          its workweek better with Australia and New Zealand.
